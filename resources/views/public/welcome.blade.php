                            This app will help you to take picture of your training targets
                            and assign values to generate your personal analytics.<br>
                            <br>
                            This is a personal project that I develop for my self. Every time
                            I go to the gun range I finish throwing away my targets and not really
                            measuring if I did any kind of improvement from my last practice day.
                            With this app I just take a picture of every target and I can add some
                            values to rate my results. Also I can include information like the
                            distance of the target, the ammo type used and my firearm configuration.<br>
                            <br>
                            I make this project publish so we can share ideas about how to improve
                            this app. Fill free to used at your convenience. You will have to register
